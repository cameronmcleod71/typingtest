# Special Character Typer

Special Character Typer is a typing test designed to help keyboardists memorize and touch type the special characters on their keyboard.

This application is made up from a backend built on Django REST Framework, connected to a PostgreSQL relational database, and a frontend built with the popular reactJS javascript library and framework.

Django REST Framework provideds authentication for user, so they can store their test results and compare their current results with their previous results. It can also provide typing data from a PostgreSQL database, and store user typing test history in the database.

React was used because its state management allow for easy access and manipulation of the typing test state.

### Planned Future Updates

- Deployment
- Programming Typing Test
- History graph that can show a users progress over a scale of previous singular tests, daily basis, weekly basis, and monthly basis.
